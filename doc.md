summary: Flogging provides an easy-to-use interface for logging events and
         errors in Fortran applications and libraries. Its use and
         functionality is similar to that of
         [logging](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) library in
         Python. It is meant to be used for providing warnings, error messages,
         debug information, or routine output which should be logged. It is not
         ideal for all output, such as that used to prompt the user for input.
